# memex-nextjs-shadcn-starter

## Overview

**memex-nextjs-shadcn-starter** is a modern Next.js starter template built with TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS. Inspired by the Shadcn UI pattern and powered by Radix UI primitives, this project comes with a comprehensive library of reusable UI components that accelerate building production-ready user interfaces.

## Features

- **Next.js & React**: Optimized for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Rich Component Library**: Includes components such as Accordion, Alert Dialog, Avatar, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Calendar, Card, Carousel, Chart, Checkbox, Collapsible, Command, Context Menu, Dialog, Drawer, Dropdown Menu, Form, Hover Card, Input (and OTP), Label, Menubar, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Fully customizable theming with light/dark modes configured in `globals.css`.
- **Modern Layout**: A clean and responsive global layout defined in `layout.tsx` with integrated Google Fonts (Inter) and essential meta tags.
- **Developer Experience**: Organized file structure and scalable components for rapid development.

## File Structure

- **app/**
  - **`page.tsx`**  
    The entry point of the application. It displays a centered message ("Start prompting.") and serves as a placeholder for your home page content.
    
  - **`layout.tsx`**  
    Defines the root layout of your app. It imports global styles, applies typography using the Inter font, and sets essential metadata.
    
  - **`globals.css`**  
    Contains Tailwind CSS directives along with custom CSS variables and base styles. It defines a comprehensive theming system for light and dark modes.

- **components/**  
  This directory holds a rich collection of UI components—from basic inputs and buttons to more complex elements like carousels, charts, and menus—each built to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and styled following modern design principles.
